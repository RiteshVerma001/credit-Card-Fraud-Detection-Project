Project Overview:
This project focuses on detecting fraudulent credit card transactions using machine learning techniques, specifically Logistic Regression. The dataset contains credit card transactions made by European cardholders over two days in September 2013, with 492 frauds out of 284,807 transactions (highly imbalanced data).
This model is trained on various types of credit card data, such as transaction amount, time, place, card number, etc. Once the model is trained, we can feed new unseen data to our system, and our system predicts whether a transaction is fraudulent or normal.
